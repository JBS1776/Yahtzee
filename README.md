# Yahtzee

This isn't only regular 5 diced Yahtzee.  This application explores what might happen if you play Yahtzee with n number of s sided dice (where s is the number of sides per die).  You get scored differently depending on how many dice and sides you specify.  Refer to the pdf file for the formulae I used to calculate scores for the types of games.
